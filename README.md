# YeetDab

This little mod yeets the dab on the Solo button out of existence. Now you can play Beat Saber again with 100% less dab. You're welcome.

## Credit
To make this mod I copied some of AceofShovels' homework from the BetterMenu mod (the image loading part of the Utils class).
I also traced the head and left saber from their dab-free solo button which is used in the BetterMenu mod. The original sprite was made by Adamek1926.
